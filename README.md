School project

The single-page app is built with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MariaDB. 
I did: - server-side rendering when the page was loaded, 10 tweets will already be there and 
      - client-side rendering, when the user tweets or scrolls down to see the following tweets (The scroll functionality has a bag).

To use the application, the user must first sign up. Upon signing up, an email containing a verification code is sent to their address via PHPMailer. 
The user needs to click the link in this email to complete verification, after which they are redirected to the login page. 
They can then log in using their profile name, email, or phone number.

A user can: - tweet, delete, and update a tweet (only if he is the owner), 
- see all the tweets and his tweets
- search for a person by using the user profile name, click on the results, and see the user profile page. The functionality to like a tweet and follow someone is still in progress.
